## How to set your own mobileprovision:

 *  Put your mobileprovision file in the ios/ folder.
 *  Reference it from toplevel 'config' file (see config-sample for an example).
      * Basename only!
 * Edit project.pbxproj.patch
      * Replace "CODE_SIGNING_IDENTITY" and "PROVISIONING_PROFILE".
      * (You can find the ID of your mobileprovision by opening it and finding its "UUID" value)
